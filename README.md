## Guide to understand the exercises and challenges

[Exercise 1](/homework1/pratice1-igti.html) - This exercise is part of the fundamentals in JavaScript languange. The FullStack Bootcamp of IGTI focus on JavaScript based frameworks.
The objective is to create a RBG color mix, and show the results on real time in a **div** tag or something like (in my case i used **output** tag).

[Exercise 2](/homework2/index.html) - This exercise is proposed to make a CRUD in Vanilla Javascript. From a **input** tag you can add new 'apostles' to the list, delete anyone else or edit. No databases, no frameworks.
